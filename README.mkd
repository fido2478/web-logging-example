OpenXC Web Logging Example Application
================================

This is a small web application that receives trace messages from an OpenXC data
recorder and writes them out to disk, split by hour. It supports visualizing a
single vehicle's data in real-time.

This application is intended as a proof-of-concept and is lacking in quite a few
areas - please do take this as a starting point for a web-enabled OpenXC
application, but don't expect this to be production-ready out of the box!

## Installation

First, I recommend installing `pip`, the Python package manager (if you don't
have it already):

    $ [sudo] easy_install pip

Next, clone this repository and install the Python requirements:

    $ git clone git@github.com:data-recorder
    $ cd data-recorder
    $ pip install -r pip-requirements.txt

While not required, I also recommend installing [Fabric][] - it's a command-line
tool that I use to create shortcuts for some common tasks (running the
development server, resetting the database, etc.).

    $ pip install fabric

[Fabric]: http://fabfile.org

## Running

Without Fabric:

    $ python recorder.py

Using Fabric:

    $ fab runserver

## Test data

You can send test data with a Fabric command:

    $ fab send_test_data:path_to_trace.json

## API

All API calls accept JSON. There is no authentication.

### Create a Vehicle

    POST /records

    {'records': [
        {'timestamp': 1332975697.078000, 'name': 'steering_wheel_angle',
                'value': 42.0},
        {'timestamp': 1332975698.078000, 'name': 'steering_wheel_angle',
                'value': 38.0}
    ]}
